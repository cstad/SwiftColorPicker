SwiftColorPicker
================

A photoshop-like color picker for iOS devices implemented in Swift.

##ToDo:
(Pull requests welcome)

1. Initialize ColorPicker with a color (curently defaults to red)
2. Provide plumbing to set the color progammatically to the ColorPicker after instantiation. This will obviously need to do everything included in picking a color; move the crosshairs and the main color selector, update the views, etc.
3. Provide better documentation
4. Unit tests

##How to use
Including the SwiftColorPicker in your application is fairly straight forward. Copy the SwiftColorPicker folder into your project and associate the UIView: ColorPicker to the UIView that you would like the ColorPicker to live.
