SwiftColorPicker
================

A Photoshop-like color picker for iOS devices implemented in Swift.

##ToDo:
(Pull requests welcome)

1. Test modifying the size of the containing UIView to determine if the ColorPicker can handle it.
2. Provide better documentation all around.
3. Unit tests.

##How to use
Including the SwiftColorPicker in your application is fairly straightforward. Copy lib/SwiftColorPicker into your project and associate the UIView: ColorPicker to the UIView that you would like the ColorPicker to live. The size/dimensions of the UIView that you use to init the ColorPicker will dictate the size of the ColorPicker.
